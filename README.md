We consider a meal delivery routing problem on a Constructor University which is represented by a directed, weighted graph.
There is a single warehouse where all vehicles start and finish. A set of customer requests is given.We also have a set of vehicles with limited capacities.
The primary objective is to minimize the completion time of the operation ( the moment when the last vehicle returns to the warehouse)
